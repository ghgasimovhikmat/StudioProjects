# Flutter project.

Requirements:
Implement "live search" - i.e. request is sent in N milliseconds (for example 300) after the user has entered some input;
Results are displayed in the list or grid of items; Request pagination - load enough items to populate the list 
and load more items every time the user scrolls to the end of the list (limit/offset);
UI can be very simple but should be responsive, snappy, and implemented according to the platform guidelines;
